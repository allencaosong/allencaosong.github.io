## Prerequisites

Although not required in all cases, Docker and Docker compose are often used when working with Server , You can refer to [runoob](https://www.runoob.com/docker/docker-tutorial.html) to quickly install the following dependencies.

- Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) version 20.10.22 or higher
- Install [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) version 1.29.2 or higher

You can use the following commands to verify if Docker and Docker Compose are installed and available:

1. Verify if Docker is installed and available <br>
   Run the following command to check the version information of Docker:
   ```
   docker --version
   ```
   If Docker is installed correctly and running, it will output the version information of Docker.

2. Verify if Docker Compose is installed and available <br>
   Run the following command to check the version information of Docker Compose:
   ```
   docker-compose --version
   ```
   If Docker Compose is installed correctly and running, it will output the version information of Docker Compose.

If the command returns the version information, it means that Docker and Docker Compose are installed and available. If there is any error or the command is not recognized, then you need to reinstall Docker and Docker Compose and ensure they are properly configured and started.

To speed up the download of image resources and save your time, it is recommended to configure a [Docker image source](https://www.runoob.com/docker/docker-mirror-acceleration.html).




## Installation

Where can your user find your project code? How can they install it (binaries, installable package, build from source)? Are there multiple options/versions they can install and how should they choose the right one for them?

## Setup

Is there any initial setup users need to do after installation to try your project?

## Try it out!

Can your users test their installation, for example by running a command or deploying a Hello World example?
